We set it to false as it is not completely essential, but is nevertheless useful to have. Another advantage of declaring this in AndroidManifest.xml is that it informs Google Play who can then inform end users that this is an NFC device. We set the permission to it being non-compulsory through the android:required tag being set to false. -->
